## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

As a recent graduate in Business Administration and Management, I am excited to be diving into the world of backend web development and continuously learning new technologies. I'm pasionate about the potential of artificial intelligence and am actively learning new techniques in machine learning and natural language processing. I'm looking forward to applying these skills to create intelligent systems that solve real-world problems.
